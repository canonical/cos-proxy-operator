"""## Overview.

## NRPE Exporter Library Usage

The `NrpeExporterProvider` object may be used by charms to call
configured `nrpe` daemons and export the job results to Prometheus
metrics to facilitate migrating from Nagios+NRPE to
Prometheus+Alertmanager. In order to do this, a charm must
instantiate the `NrpeExporterProvider` object, and optionally a list
of relations which will be checked for `monitor` data to configure
Prometheus jobs.

The parent charm should also provide an instantiated
`MetricsEndpointAggregator`, so events sent from this library can be
consumed and sent through the Prometheus relation, by responding to
`NrpeTargetsChangedEvent`.
